## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handled categorical and numerical variables  
   - Applied one-hot encoding  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Built a **Decision Tree Classifier** using scikit-learn  
   - Tuned hyperparameters (max depth, criterion, etc.)  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Insights into customer purchase behavior

## 📊 Results
- Achieved a working decision tree model that predicts customer purchase decisions  
- Discovered which demographic and behavioral factors strongly influence outcomes
